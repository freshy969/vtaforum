# vtaforum
simple forum based on php and mysql using google api

this is my first github project for beginner php programmers to know the structure and methods for building a forum. the project 
is built from scratch without frame works like laveral , cakephp .the project uses bootstrap for templates.

the code is pretty easy to follow as me too not an experienced web developer

the project contains features of tags,mentions,threads,likes,comments,routes(follow) and it uses google api to signup and login so
you should definitely get a google 'client id' , 'client id' , 'client secret' , 'redirect url' and change the values in 'config.php'.
